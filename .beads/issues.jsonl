This epic ensures direct connections work optimally.\n\n## Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n- Configure ufw (Linux) to allow Syncthing ports\n- Configure pf/application firewall (Darwin) to allow Syncthing\n- Support both IPv4 and IPv6\n- Document firewall configuration in role README\n- Validate firewall rules applied correctly\n- Test connectivity between peers after firewall configuration\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n- Router/gateway firewall configuration (manual, environment-specific)\n- Port forwarding configuration (UPnP handles this automatically)\n- VPN/ZeroTier firewall rules (handled by those services)\n- Custom Syncthing port configuration (uses defaults)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Child task fleet-zmb completed: Linux ufw rules configured\n- [ ] Child task fleet-jj1 completed: Darwin firewall rules configured\n- [ ] Child task fleet-7d6 completed: Port listening validation implemented\n- [ ] Child task fleet-67f completed: Peer connectivity testing implemented\n- [ ] Child task fleet-0mw completed: Connection type verification via API implemented\n- [ ] Child task fleet-y3k completed: Firewall configuration documented in README\n- [ ] Child task fleet-11m completed: Integration test created and passing\n- [ ] All firewall rules tested on both Linux and Darwin platforms\n- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate\n- [ ] Integration test validates entire firewall configuration","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Child task fleet-zmb completed: Linux ufw rules configured\n- [ ] Child task fleet-jj1 completed: Darwin firewall rules configured\n- [ ] Child task fleet-7d6 completed: Port listening validation implemented\n- [ ] Child task fleet-67f completed: Peer connectivity testing implemented\n- [ ] Child task fleet-0mw completed: Connection type verification via API implemented\n- [ ] Child task fleet-y3k completed: Firewall configuration documented in README\n- [ ] Child task fleet-11m completed: Integration test created and passing\n- [ ] All firewall rules tested on both Linux and Darwin platforms\n- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate\n- [ ] Integration test validates entire firewall configuration","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-27T14:45:03Z","updated_at":"2026-01-27T19:45:06Z"}
